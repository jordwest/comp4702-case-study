A Novel Kernel Method For Clustering
------------------------------------

This report gives an overview of the author’s attempt to replicate
the results of the proposed clustering method from the paper
“A Novel Kernel Method For Clustering” [1]. As the original paper
does not provide complete details on the implementation of the
proposed clustering algorithm (hereby referred to as the new
algorithm), some assumptions are made in an attempt to replicate
the algorithm. In addition, the result of K-means clustering on
the same data sets is attempted for comparison to the original
paper. The other existing clustering algorithms (SOM, Neural Gas,
Ng-Jordan) tested in the original paper are not investigated in
this report.
